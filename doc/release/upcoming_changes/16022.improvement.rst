MaskedArray gains a ``__array_ufunc__`` method to better handle ufuncs
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The MaskedArray class now has an implementation of `__array_ufunc__` that
handles deferrals to the desired implementations of the ufunc. If a masked
implementation of a ufunc exists, that implementation will take priority.
This means that code called with MaskedArray ma as ``np.ufunc(ma)`` will
behave the same as ``np.ma.ufunc(ma)``. Additionally, adding this helps with
dispatching to subclasses and preserving the proper types when another
implementation should take priority.
