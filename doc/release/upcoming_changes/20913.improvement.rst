IBM zSystems Vector Extension Facility (SIMD)
---------------------------------------------

Added support for SIMD extensions of zSystem (z13, z14, z15),
through the universal intrinsics interface. This support leads
to performance improvements for all SIMD kernels implemented
using the universal intrinsics, including the following operations:

rint, floor, trunc, ceil, sqrt, absolute, square, reciprocal, tanh, sin, cos,
equal, not_equal, greater, greater_equal, less, less_equal,
maximum, minimum, fmax, fmin, argmax, argmin,
add, subtract, multiply, divide.
