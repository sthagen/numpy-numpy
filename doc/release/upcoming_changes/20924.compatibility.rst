``array.fill(scalar)`` may behave slightly different
----------------------------------------------------
`~numpy.ndarray.fill` may in some cases behave slightly different
now due to the fact that the logic is aligned with item assignment::

    arr = np.array([1])  # with any dtype/value
    arr.fill(scalar)
    # is now identical to:
    arr[0] = scalar

Previously casting may have produced slightly different answers when using
values that could not be represented in the target ``dtype`` or when the
target had ``object`` dtype.
