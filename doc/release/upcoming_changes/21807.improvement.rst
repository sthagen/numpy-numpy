F2PY supports the value attribute
=================================

The Fortran standard requires that variables declared with the ``value``
attribute must be passed by value instead of reference. F2PY now supports this
use pattern correctly. So ``integer, intent(in), value :: x`` in Fortran codes
will have correct wrappers generated.
