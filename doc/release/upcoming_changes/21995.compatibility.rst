Returned arrays respect uniqueness of dtype kwarg objects
---------------------------------------------------------
When the ``dtype`` keyword argument is used with :py:func:`np.array()`
or :py:func:`asarray()`, the dtype of the returned array now
always exactly matches the dtype provided by the caller.

In some cases this change means that a *view* rather than the
input array is returned.
The following is an example for this on 64bit Linux where ``long``
and ``longlong`` are the same precision but different ``dtypes``::

    >>> arr = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype="long")
    >>> new_dtype = np.dtype("longlong")
    >>> new = np.asarray(arr, dtype=new_dtype)
    >>> new.dtype is new_dtype
    True
    >>> new is arr
    False

Before the change, the ``dtype`` did not match because ``new is arr``
was ``True``.
