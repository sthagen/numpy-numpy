``nditer``/``NpyIter`` allows all allocating all operands
---------------------------------------------------------
The NumPy iterator available through `np.nditer` in Python
and as ``NpyIter`` in C now supports allocating all arrays.

The iterator shape defaults to ``()`` in this case.  The operands
dtype must be provided, since a "common dtype" cannot be inferred
from the other inputs.
