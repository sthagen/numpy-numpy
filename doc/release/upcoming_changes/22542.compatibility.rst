DLPack export raises ``BufferError``
------------------------------------
When an array buffer cannot be exported via DLPack a
``BufferError`` is now always raised where previously
``TypeError`` or ``RuntimeError`` was raised.
This allows falling back to the buffer protocol or
``__array_interface__`` when DLPack was tried first.
