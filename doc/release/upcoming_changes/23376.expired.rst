Environment variable to disable dispatching removed
---------------------------------------------------
Support for the ``NUMPY_EXPERIMENTAL_ARRAY_FUNCTION`` environment variable has
been removed. This variable disabled dispatching with ``__array_function__``.

Support for ``y=`` as an alias of ``out=`` removed
--------------------------------------------------
The ``fix``, ``isposinf`` and ``isneginf`` functions allowed using ``y=`` as a
(deprecated) alias for ``out=``. This is no longer supported.
