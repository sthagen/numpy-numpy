By default, the exported NumPy C API is now compatible with NumPy 1.19
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting with NumPy 1.25 when including NumPy headers, NumPy now
defaults to exposing a backwards compatible API.
This means that by default binaries such as wheels build against
NumPy 1.25 will also work with NumPy 1.16 because it has the same API version
as NumPy 1.19 which is the oldest NumPy version compatible with Python 3.9.

You can customize this behavior using::

    #define NPY_TARGET_VERSION NPY_1_22_API_VERSION

or the equivalent ``-D`` option to the compiler.  For more details
please see `for-downstream-package-authors`_.
A change should only be required in rare cases when a package relies on newly
added C-API.
