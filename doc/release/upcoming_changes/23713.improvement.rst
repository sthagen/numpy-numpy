Signed and unsigned integers always compare correctly
-----------------------------------------------------
When ``uint64`` and ``int64`` are mixed in NumPy, NumPy typically
promotes both to ``float64``.  This behavior may be argued about
but is confusing for comparisons ``==``, ``<=``, since the results
returned can be incorrect but the conversion is hidden since the
result is a boolean.
NumPy will now return the correct results for these by avoiding
the cast to float.
