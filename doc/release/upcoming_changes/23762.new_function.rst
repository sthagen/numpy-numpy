Matrix transpose support for ndarrays
-------------------------------------
NumPy now offers support for calculating the matrix transpose of an array. The
matrix transpose is equivalent to swapping the last two axes of an array. Both
``np.ndarray`` and ``np.ma.MaskedArray`` now expose an ``.mT`` attribute.
