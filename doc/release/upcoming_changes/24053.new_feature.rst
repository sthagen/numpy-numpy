Support for the updated Accelerate BLAS/LAPACK library, including ILP64 (64-bit
integer) support, in macOS 13.3 has been added. This brings arm64 support, and
significant performance improvements of up to 10x for commonly used linear
algebra operations. When Accelerate is selected at build time, the 13.3+
version will automatically be used if available.
