Add mean keyword to var and std function
----------------------------------------
Often when the standard deviation is needed the mean is also needed. The same
holds for the variance and the mean. Until now the mean is then calculated twice,
the change introduced here for the var and std functions allows for passing in a
precalculated mean as an keyword argument. See the doc-strings for details and an
example illustrating the speed-up.
