Default integer now 64bit on 64bit windows
------------------------------------------
The default NumPy integer is now 64bit on all 64bit systems as the
historic 32bit default on windows was a common source of issues.
Most users should not notice this, the main issues may occur
with code interfacing with libraries written in a compiled language
like C.  For more information see :ref:`migration_windows_int64`.
