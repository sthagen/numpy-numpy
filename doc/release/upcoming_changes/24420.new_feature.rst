Improved CPU optimization tracking
----------------------------------

Introduces a tracer mechanism that enables tracking of the enabled targets
for each optimized function in the NumPy library. With this enhancement,
it becomes possible to precisely monitor the enabled CPU dispatch
targets for the dispatched functions.

A new function named `opt_func_info` has been added to the new namespace `numpy.lib.introspect`,
offering this tracing capability. This function allows you to retrieve information
about the enabled targets based on function names and data type signatures.
