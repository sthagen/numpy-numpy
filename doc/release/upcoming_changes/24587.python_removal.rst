* ``np.compare_chararrays`` has been removed from the main namespace. 
  Use ``np.char.compare_chararrays`` instead.

* The ``charrarray`` in the main namespace has been deprecated. It can be imported
  without a deprecation warning from ``np.char.chararray`` for now,
  but we are planning to fully deprecate and remove ``chararray`` in the future.

* ``np.format_parser`` has been removed from the main namespace. 
  Use ``np.rec.format_parser`` instead.
