Renamed ``numpy.core`` to ``numpy._core``
-----------------------------------------
Accessing ``numpy.core`` now emits a DeprecationWarning. In practice
we have found that most downstream usage of ``numpy.core`` was to access
functionality that is available in the main ``numpy`` namespace.
If for some reason you are using functionality in ``numpy.core`` that
is not available in the main ``numpy`` namespace, this means you are likely
using private NumPy internals. You can still access these internals via
``numpy._core`` without a deprecation warning but we do not provide any
backward compatibility guarantees for NumPy internals. Please open an issue
if you think a mistake was made and something needs to be made public.
