Call ``str`` automatically on third argument to functions like `assert_equal`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The third argument to functions like `assert_equal` now has ``str`` called on
it automatically. This way it mimics the built-in ``assert`` statement, where
``assert_equal(a, b, obj)`` works like ``assert a == b, obj``.
