``diagonal`` and ``trace`` for `numpy.linalg`
---------------------------------------------

`numpy.linalg.diagonal` and `numpy.linalg.trace` have been
added, which are Array API compatible variants of `numpy.diagonal`
and `numpy.trace`. They differ in the default axis selection
which define 2-D sub-arrays.
