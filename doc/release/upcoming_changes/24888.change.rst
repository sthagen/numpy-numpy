Redefinition of ``np.intp``/``np.uintp`` (almost never a change)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Due to the actual use of these types almost always matching the use of
``size_t``/``Py_ssize_t`` this is now the definition in C.
Previously, it matched ``intptr_t`` and ``uintptr_t`` which would often
have been subtly incorrect.
This has no effect on the vast majority of machines since the size
of these types only differ on extremely niche platforms.

However, it means that:
* Pointers may not necessarily fit into an ``intp`` typed array anymore.
  The ``p`` and ``P`` character codes can still be used, however.
* Creating ``intptr_t`` or ``uintptr_t`` typed arrays in C remains possible
  in a cross-platform way via ``PyArray_DescrFromType('p')``.
* The new character codes ``nN`` were introduced.
* It is now correct to use the Python C-API functions when parsing
  to ``npy_intp`` typed arguments.
