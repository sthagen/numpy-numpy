Consistent failure messages in `numpy.testing`
----------------------------------------------

Previously, some `numpy.testing` assertions printed messages that
referred to the actual and desired results as ``x`` and ``y``.
Now, these values are consistently referred to as ``ACTUAL`` and
``DESIRED``.
