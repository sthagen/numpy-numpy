``__array_prepare__`` is removed
--------------------------------
UFuncs called ``__array_prepare__`` before running computations
for normal ufunc calls (not generalized ufuncs, reductions, etc.).
The function was also called instead of ``__array_wrap__`` on the
results of some linear algebra functions.

It is now removed, if you use it (e.g. old unit implementations)
migrate to ``__array_ufunc__`` or rely on ``__array_wrap__``
which is called with a context in all cases, although after the
result array is filled.
In those paths, ``__array_wrap__`` will now be passed a base
class, rather than a subclass array.
