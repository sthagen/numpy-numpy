* The advanced indexing ``MapIter`` and related API has been removed.
  The (truly) public part of it was not well tested and had only one
  known user (Theano).  Making it private will simplify improvements
  to speed up ``ufunc.at`` and make advanced indexing more maintainable
  and was important for allowing 64 dimensional arrays.
  Please let us know if this API is important to you so we can find a
  solution together.
