Lager ``NPY_MAXDIMS`` and ``NPY_MAXARGS``, ``NPY_RAVEL_AXIS`` introduced
------------------------------------------------------------------------

``NPY_MAXDIMS`` is now 64, you may want to review its use.  This is usually
used in a stack allocation, where the increase should be safe.
However, we do encourage generally to remove any use of ``NPY_MAXDIMS`` and
``NPY_MAXARGS`` to eventually allow removing the constraint completely.
For the conversion helper and C-API functions mirrowing Python ones such as
``tale``, ``NPY_MAXDIMS`` was used to mean ``axis=None`` these must be
replaced with ``NPY_RAVEL_AXIS``.  See also :ref:`migration_maxdims`.
