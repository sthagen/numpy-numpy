Out-of-bound axis not the same as ``axis=None``
-----------------------------------------------
In some cases ``axis=32`` or for concatenate any large value
was the same as ``axis=None``.
Except for ``concatenate`` this was deprecate.
Any out of bound axis value will now error, make sure to use
``axis=None``.
