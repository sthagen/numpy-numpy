``loadtxt`` and ``genfromtxt`` default to ``encoding=None``
-----------------------------------------------------------
``loadtxt`` and ``genfromtxt`` now both default to ``encoding=None``
which may mainly modifies how ``converters`` work.
These will now be passed ``str`` rather than ``bytes``, pass the
encoding explicitly to always get the new or old behavior.
For ``genfromtxt`` the change also means that returned values will now be
unicode strings rather than bytes.
