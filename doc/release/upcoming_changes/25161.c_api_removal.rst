``PyArray_GetCastFunc`` was removed
-----------------------------------
Note that custom legacy user dtypes can still provide a castfunc
as their implementation, but any access to them is now removed.
The reason for this is that NumPy never used these internally
for many years.
If you use simple numeric types, please just use C casts directly.
In case you require an alternative, please let us know so we can
create new API such as ``PyArray_CastBuffer()`` which could
use old or new cast functions depending on the NumPy version.
