New ``copy`` keyword meaning for `numpy.array` and `numpy.asarray`
------------------------------------------------------------------
Now `numpy.array` and `numpy.asarray` support three values for ``copy`` parameter:
* ``None`` - A copy will only be made if it is necessary.
* ``True`` - Always make a copy.
* ``False`` - Never make a copy. If a copy is required a ``ValueError`` is raised.

The meaning of ``False`` changed as it now raises an exception if a copy is needed.
