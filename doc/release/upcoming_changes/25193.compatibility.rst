The ``f2py.compile()`` helper has been removed because it leaked memory, has
been marked as experimental for several years now, and was implemented as a thin
``subprocess.run`` wrapper. It is also one of the test bottlenecks. See
`gh-25122 <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/25122>`_ for the full
rationale. It also used several ``np.distutils`` features which are too fragile
to be ported to work with ``meson``.

Users are urged to replace calls to ``f2py.compile`` with calls to
``subprocess.run("python", "-m", "numpy.f2py",...`` instead, and to use
environment variables to interact with ``meson``. `Native files
<https://mesonbuild.com/Machine-files.html>`_ are also an option.
