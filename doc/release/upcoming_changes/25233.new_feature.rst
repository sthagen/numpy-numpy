``ndarray.device`` and ``ndarray.to_device``
--------------------------------------------

``ndarray.device`` attribute and ``ndarray.to_device`` method were
added to `numpy.ndarray` class for Array API compatibility.

Additionally, ``device`` keyword-only arguments were added to:
`numpy.asarray`, `numpy.arange`, `numpy.empty`, `numpy.empty_like`,
`numpy.eye`, `numpy.full`, `numpy.full_like`, `numpy.linspace`,
`numpy.ones`, `numpy.ones_like`, `numpy.zeros`, and `numpy.zeros_like`.

For all these new arguments, only ``device="cpu"`` is supported.
