``NPY_MAXARGS`` not constant and ``PyArrayMultiIterObject`` size change
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Since ``NPY_MAXARGS`` was increased, it is now a runtime constant and not
compiletime constant anymore.
We expect almost no users to notice this.  But if used for stack allocations
it now must be replaced with a custom constant using ``NPY_MAXARGS`` as an
additional runtime check.

The ``sizeof(PyArrayMultiIterObject)`` does now not include the full size
of the object.  We expect nobody to notice this change.  It was necessary
to avoid issues with Cython.
