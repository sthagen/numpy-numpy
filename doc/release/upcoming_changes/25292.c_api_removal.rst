* ``PyArrayFlags_Type`` and ``PyArray_NewFlagsObject`` as well as
  ``PyArrayFlagsObject`` are private now.
  There is no known use-case, use the Python API if needed.
* ``PyArray_MoveInto``, ``PyArray_CastTo``, ``PyArray_CastAnyTo`` are removed
  use ``PyArray_CopyInto`` and if absolutely needed ``PyArray_CopyAnyInto``
  (the latter does a flat copy).
* ``PyArray_FillObjectArray`` is removed, its only true use is for
  implementing ``np.empty``.  Create a new empty array or use
  ``PyArray_FillWithScalar()`` (decrefs existing objects).
* ``PyArray_CompareUCS4`` and ``PyArray_CompareString`` are removed.
  Use the standard C string comparison functions.
* ``PyArray_ISPYTHON`` is removed as it is misleading, has no known
  use-cases and easy to replace.
* ``PyArray_FieldNames`` is removed as it is unclear what it would
  be useful for.  It also has incorrect semantics in some possible
  use-cases.
* ``PyArray_TypestrConvert`` since it seems a misnomer and unlikely
  to be used by anyone.  If you know the size or are limited to
  few types, just use it explicitly, otherwise go via Python
  strings.
