``arange``'s ``start`` argument is positional-only
--------------------------------------------------
The first argument of ``arange`` is now positional only. This way,
specifying a ``start`` argument as a keyword, e.g. ``arange(start=0, stop=4)``,
raises a TypeError. Other behaviors, are unchanged so ``arange(stop=4)``,
``arange(2, stop=4)`` and so on, are still valid and have the same meaning as
before.
