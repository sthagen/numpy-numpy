* A C API for working with `numpy.dtypes.StringDType` arrays has been
  exposed. This includes functions for acquiring and releasing mutexes locking
  access to the string data as well as packing and unpacking UTF-8 bytestreams
  from array entries.
* ``NPY_NTYPES`` is now version-dependent to accomadate the availability of a
  new NumPy built-in DType. It is now defined in ``npy2_compat.h``.
* ``NPY_NTYPES_LEGACY`` is now defined in ``ndarraytypes.h``, use this value
  if you do not wish to update code to support dtypes written using the new
  DType API that may not function in the same way as legacy dtypes.
