* A C API for working with `numpy.dtypes.StringDType` arrays has been
  exposed. This includes functions for acquiring and releasing mutexes locking
  access to the string data as well as packing and unpacking UTF-8 bytestreams
  from array entries.
* ``NPY_NTYPES`` has been renamed to ``NPY_NTYPES_LEGACY`` as it does not
  include new NumPy built-in DTypes. In particular the new string DType
  will likely not work correctly with code that handles legacy DTypes.
