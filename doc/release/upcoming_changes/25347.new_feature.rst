StringDType has been added to NumPy
-----------------------------------

We have added a new variable-width UTF-8 encoded string data type, implementing
a "NumPy array of python strings", including support for a user-provided missing
data sentinel. It is intended as a drop-in replacement for arrays of python
strings and missing data sentinels using the object dtype. See `NEP 55
<https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0055-string_dtype.html>`_ and :ref:`the
documentation <stringdtype>` for more details.
