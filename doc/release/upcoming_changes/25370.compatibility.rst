Make ``numpy.array_api`` more portable
--------------------------------------

``numpy.array_api`` no longer uses ``"cpu"`` as its "device", but rather a
separate ``CPU_DEVICE`` object (which is not accessible in the namespace).
This is because "cpu" is not part of the array API standard.

``numpy.array_api`` now uses separate wrapped objects for dtypes. Previously
it reused the ``numpy`` dtype objects. This makes it clear which behaviors on
dtypes are part of the array API standard (effectively, the standard only
requires ``==``  on dtype objects).

``numpy.array_api.nonzero`` now errors on zero-dimensional arrays, as required
by the array API standard.
