Cleanup of initialization of ``numpy.dtype`` with strings with commas
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The interpretation of strings with commas is changed slightly, in that a
trailing comma will now always create a structured dtype.  E.g., where
previously ``np.dtype("i")`` and ``np.dtype("i,")`` were treated as identical,
now ``np.dtype("i,")`` will create a structured dtype, with a single
field. This is analogous to ``np.dtype("i,i")`` creating a structured dtype
with two fields, and makes the behaviour consistent with that expected of
tuples.

At the same time, the use of single number surrounded by parenthesis to
indicate a sub-array shape, like in ``np.dtype("(2)i,")``, is deprecated.
Instead; one should use ``np.dtype("(2,)i")`` or ``np.dtype("2i")``.
Eventually, using a number in parentheses will raise an exception, like is the
case for initializations without a comma, like ``np.dtype("(2)i")``.
