Change in how complex sign is calculated
----------------------------------------
Following the API Array standard, the complex sign is now calculated as
``z / |z|`` (instead of the rather less logical case where the sign of
the real part was taken, unless the real part was zero, in which case
the sign of the imaginary part was returned).  Like for real numbers,
zero is returned if ``z==0``.
