New functions for matrix-vector and vector-matrix products
----------------------------------------------------------

Two new generalized ufuncs were defined:

* `numpy.matvec` - matrix-vector product, treating the arguments as
  stacks of matrices and column vectors, respectively.

* `numpy.vecmat` - vector-matrix product, treating the arguments as
  stacks of column vectors and matrices, respectively. For complex
  vectors, the conjugate is taken.

These add to the existing `numpy.matmul` as well as to `numpy.vecdot`,
which was added in numpy 2.0.

Note that `numpy.matmul` never takes a complex conjugate, also not
when its left input is a vector, while both `numpy.vecdot` and
`numpy.vecmat` do take the conjugate for complex vectors on the
left-hand side (which are taken to be the ones that are transposed,
following the physics convention).
