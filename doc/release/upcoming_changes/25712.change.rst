``any`` and ``all`` return booleans for object arrays
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``any`` and ``all`` functions and methods now return
booleans also for object arrays.  Previously, they did
a reduction which behaved like the Python ``or`` and
``and`` operators which evaluates to one of the arguments.
You can use ``np.logical_or.reduce`` and ``np.logical_and.reduce``
to achieve the previous behavior.
