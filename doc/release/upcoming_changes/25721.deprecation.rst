``np.linalg.lstsq`` now defaults to new ``rcond`` value
-------------------------------------------------------
`~numpy.linalg.lstsq` now uses the new rcond value of the machine precision
times ``max(M, N)``.  Previously, the machine precision was used but a
FutureWarning was given to notify that this change will happen eventually.
That old behavior can still be achieved by passing ``rcond=-1``.
