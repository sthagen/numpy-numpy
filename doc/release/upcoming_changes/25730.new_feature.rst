configtool and pkg-config support
---------------------------------

A new ``numpy-config`` CLI script is available that can be queried for the
NumPy version and for compile flags needed to use the NumPy C API. This will
allow build systems to better support the use of NumPy as a dependency.
Also, a ``numpy.pc`` pkg-config file is now included with Numpy. In order to
find its location for use with ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH``, use
``numpy-config --pkgconfigdir``.
