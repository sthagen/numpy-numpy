New Public DType API
--------------------

The C implementation of the NEP 42 DType API is now public. While the DType API
has shipped in NumPy for a few versions, it was only usable in sessions with a
special environment variable set. It is now possible to write custom DTypes
outside of NumPy using the new DType API and the normal ``import_array()``
mechanism for importing the numpy C API.

See :ref:`dtype-api` for more details about the API. As always with a new
feature, please report any bugs you run into implementing or using a new
DType. It is likely that downstream C code that works with dtypes will need to
be updated to work correctly with new DTypes.
