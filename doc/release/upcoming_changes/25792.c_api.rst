Required changes for custom legacy user dtypes
----------------------------------------------
In order to improve our DTypes it is unfortunately necessary
to break with ABI, which requires some changes for dtypes registered
with `PyArray_RegisterDataType`.
Please see the documentation of `PyArray_RegisterDataType` for how
to adapt your code and achieve compatibility with both 1.x and 2.x.
