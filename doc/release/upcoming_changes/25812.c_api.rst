* The ``->f`` slot has been removed from ``PyArray_Descr``.
  If you use this slot, replace accessing it with
  `PyDataType_GetArrFuncs` (see its documentation and the `numpy-2-migration-guide`_).
  In some cases using other functions like ``PyArray_GETITEM`` may
  be an alterantives.
* ``PyArray_GETITEM`` and ``PyArray_SETITEM`` now require the import of the
  NumPy API table to be used and are no longer defined in ``ndarraytypes.h``.
