* Due to runtime dependencies, the definition for functionality accessing
  the dtype flags was moved from ``numpy/ndarraytypes.h`` and is only available
  after including ``numpy/ndarrayobject.h`` as it requires ``import_array()``.
  This includes ``PyDataType_FLAGCHK``, ``PyDataType_REFCHK`` and
  ``NPY_BEGIN_THREADS_DESCR``.
* The dtype flags on ``PyArray_Descr`` must now be accessed through the
  ``PyDataType_FLAGS`` inline function to be compatible with both 1.x and 2.x.
  This function is defined in ``npy_2_compat.h`` to allow backporting.
  Most or all users should use ``PyDataType_FLAGCHK`` which is available on
  1.x and does not require backporting.
  *Cython* users should use Cython 3.  Otherwise access will go through Python
  unless they use ``PyDataType_FLAGCHK`` instead.
