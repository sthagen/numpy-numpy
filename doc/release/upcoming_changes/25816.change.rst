* The ``dtype.flags`` value was previously usually stored as a
  signed integer.  This means that the aligned dtype struct flag
  lead to neagtive flags being set (-128 rather than ``128``).
  This flag is now stored usigned (positive).
  Code which checks flags manually may need to adapt.  This
  may include code compiled with Cython 2.
