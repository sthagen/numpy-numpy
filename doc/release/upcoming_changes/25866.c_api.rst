New C-API import functions
--------------------------
We have now added ``PyArray_ImportNumPyAPI`` and ``PyUFunc_ImportUFuncAPI``
as static inline functions to import the NumPy C-API tables.
The new functions have two advantages over `import_array` and `import_ufunc`:
- They check whether the import was already performed and are light-weight
  if not, allowing to add them judiciously (although this is not preferable
  in most cases).
- The old mechanisms were macros rather than functions which included a
  ``return`` statement.

The ``PyArray_ImportNumPyAPI()`` function is included in ``npy_2_compat.h``
for simpler backporting.
