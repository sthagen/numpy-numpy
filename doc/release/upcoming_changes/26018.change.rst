``unique_values`` may return unsorted data
------------------------------------------
The relatively new function (added in NumPy 2.0) ``unique_values`` may now
return unsorted results.  Just as ``unique_counts`` and ``unique_all``
these never guaranteed a sorted result, however, the result
was sorted until now.  In cases where these do return a sorted result, this
may change in future releases to improve performance.
