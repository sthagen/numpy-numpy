Performance improvements to ``np.unique``
-----------------------------------------
``np.unique`` now tries to use a hash table to find unique values instead of sorting
values before finding unique values. This is limited to certain dtypes for now, and
the function is now faster for those dtypes. The function now also exposes a ``sorted``
parameter to allow returning unique values as they were found, instead of sorting them
afterwards.
