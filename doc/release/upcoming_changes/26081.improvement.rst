``ndarray`` shape-type parameter is now covariant and bound to ``tuple[int, ...]``
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Static typing for ``ndarray`` is a long-term effort that continues
with this change.  It is a generic type with type parameters for
the shape and the data type.  Previously, the shape type parameter could be
any value.  This change restricts it to a tuple of ints, as one would expect
from using ``ndarray.shape``.  Further, the shape-type parameter has been
changed from invariant to covariant.  This change also applies to the subtypes
of ``ndarray``, e.g. ``numpy.ma.MaskedArray``.  See the
`typing docs <https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/generics.html#variance-of-generic-types>`_
for more information.
