Interactive examples in the NumPy documentation
-----------------------------------------------

The NumPy documentation includes a number of examples that
can now be run interactively in your browser using WebAssembly
and Pyodide.

Please note that the examples are currently experimental in
nature and may not work as expected for all methods in the
public API.
