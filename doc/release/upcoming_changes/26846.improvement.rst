The `numpy.printoptions` context manager is now thread and async-safe
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In prior versions of NumPy, the printoptions were defined using a combination
of Python and C global variables. We have refactored so the state is stored in
a python ``ContextVar``, making the context manager thread and async-safe.
