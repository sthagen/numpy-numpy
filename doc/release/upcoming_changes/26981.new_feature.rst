``f2py`` can generate freethreading-compatible C extensions
-----------------------------------------------------------

Pass ``--freethreading-compatible`` to the f2py CLI tool to produce a C
extension marked as compatible with the free threading CPython
interpreter. Doing so prevents the interpreter from re-enabling the GIL at
runtime when it imports the C extension. Note that ``f2py`` does not analyze
fortran code for thread safety, so you must verify that the wrapped fortran
code is thread safe before marking the extension as compatible.
