NEP 50 promotion state option removed
-------------------------------------
The NEP 50 promotion state settings are now removed. They were always
meant as temporary means for testing.
A warning will be given if the environment variable is set to anything
but ``NPY_PROMOTION_STATE=weak`` wile ``_set_promotion_state``
and ``_get_promotion_state`` are removed.
In case code used ``_no_nep50_warning``, a ``contextlib.nullcontext``
could be used to replace it when not available.
