* The type annotations of ``numpy.float64`` and ``numpy.complex128`` now
  reflect that they are also subtypes of the built-in ``float`` and ``complex``
  types, respectively. This update prevents static type-checkers from reporting
  errors in cases such as:

  .. code-block:: python

     x: float = numpy.float64(6.28)  # valid
     z: complex = numpy.complex128(-1j)  # valid
