Changes to the main iterator and potential numerical changes
------------------------------------------------------------
The main iterator, used in math functions and via ``np.nditer`` from Python
and ``NpyIter`` in C, now behaves differently for some buffered iterations.
This means that:

* The buffer size used will often be smaller than the maximum buffer sized
  allowed by the ``buffersize`` parameter.
* The "growinner" flag is now honored with buffered reductions when no operand
  requires buffering.

For ``np.sum()`` such changes in buffersize may slightly change numerical
results of floating point operations.
Users who use "growinner" for custom reductions could notice
changes in precision (for example, in NumPy we removed it from
``einsum`` to avoid most precision changes and improve precision
for some 64bit floating point inputs).
