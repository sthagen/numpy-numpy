New `NpyIter_GetTransferFlags` and ``NpyIter_IterationNeedsAPI`` change
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
NumPy now has the new `NpyIter_GetTransferFlags` function as a more precise
way checking of iterator/buffering needs.  I.e. whether the Python API/GIL is
required or floating point errors may occur.
This function is also faster if you already know your needs without buffering.

The ``NpyIter_IterationNeedsAPI`` function now performs all the checks that were
previously performed at setup time.  While it was never necessary to call it
multiple times, doing so will now have a larger cost.
