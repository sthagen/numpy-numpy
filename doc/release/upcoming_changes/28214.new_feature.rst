NumPy now registers its pkg-config paths with the pkgconf_ PyPI package
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The pkgconf_ PyPI package provides an interface for projects like NumPy to
register their own paths to be added to the pkg-config search path. This means
that when using pkgconf_ from PyPI, NumPy will be discoverable without needing
for any custom environment configuration.

.. attention:: Attention

    This only applies when using the pkgconf_ package from PyPI_, or put another
    way, this only applies when installing pkgconf_ via a Python package
    manager.

    If you are using ``pkg-config`` or ``pkgconf`` provided by your system, or
    any other source that does not use the pkgconf-pypi_ project, the NumPy
    pkg-config directory will not be automatically added to the search path. In
    these situations, you might want to use ``numpy-config``.
