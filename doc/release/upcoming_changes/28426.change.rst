Changes to automatic bin selection in numpy.histogram
-----------------------------------------------------
The automatic bin selection algorithm in ``numpy.histogram`` has been modified
to avoid out-of-memory errors for samples with low variation.
For full control over the selected bins the user can use set
the ``bin`` or ``range`` parameters of ``numpy.histogram``.
