Build manylinux_2_28 wheels
---------------------------

Wheels for linux systems will use the ``manylinux_2_28`` tag (instead of the ``manylinux2014`` tag), which means
dropping support for redhat7/centos7, amazonlinux2, debian9, ubuntu18.04, and
other pre-glibc2.28 operating system versions, as per the `PEP 600 support
table`_.
