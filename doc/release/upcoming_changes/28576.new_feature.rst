Allow ``out=...`` in ufuncs to ensure array result
--------------------------------------------------
NumPy has the sometimes difficult behavior that it currently usually
returns scalars rather than 0-D arrays (even if the inputs were 0-D arrays).
This is especially problematic for non-numerical dtypes (e.g. ``object``).

For ufuncs (i.e. most simple math functions) it is now possible
to use ``out=...`` (literally `...`, e.g. ``out=Ellipsis``) which is identical in behavior to ``out`` not
being passed, but will ensure a non-scalar return.
This spelling is borrowed from ``arr1d[0, ...]`` where the ``...``
also ensures a non-scalar return.

Other functions with an ``out=`` kwarg should gain support eventually.
Downstream libraries that interoperate via ``__array_ufunc__`` or
``__array_function__`` may need to adapt to support this.
