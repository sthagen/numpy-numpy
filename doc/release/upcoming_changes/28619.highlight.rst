Building NumPy with OpenMP Parallelization
-------------------------------------------
NumPy now supports OpenMP parallel processing capabilities when built with the
``-Denable_openmp=true`` Meson build flag. This feature is disabled by default.
When enabled, ``np.sort`` and ``np.argsort`` functions can utilize OpenMP for
parallel thread execution, improving performance for these operations.
