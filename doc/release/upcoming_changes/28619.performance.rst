Performance improvements to ``np.sort`` and ``np.argsort``
----------------------------------------------------------
``np.sort`` and ``np.argsort`` functions now can leverage OpenMP for parallel
thread execution, resulting in up to 3.5x speedups on x86 architectures with
AVX2 or AVX-512 instructions. This opt-in feature requires NumPy to be built
with the -Denable_openmp Meson flag. Users can control the number of threads
used by setting the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable.
