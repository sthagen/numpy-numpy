Performance improvements for ``np.float16`` casts
--------------------------------------------------
Earlier, floating point casts to and from ``np.float16`` types
were emulated in software on all platforms.

Now, on ARM devices that support Neon float16 intrinsics (such as
recent Apple Silicon), the native float16 path is used to achieve
the best performance.
