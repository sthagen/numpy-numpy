"""
**Note:** almost all functions in the ``numpy.lib`` namespace
are also present in the main ``numpy`` namespace.  Please use the
functions as ``np.<funcname>`` where possible.

``numpy.lib`` is mostly a space for implementing functions that don't
belong in core or in another NumPy submodule with a clear purpose
(e.g. ``random``, ``fft``, ``linalg``, ``ma``).

Most contains basic functions that are used by several submodules and are
useful to have in the main name-space.
